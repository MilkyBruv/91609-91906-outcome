MAKE SURE JAVA 17 JDK AND JRE IS INSTALLED AND "JAVA_HOME" PATH VARIABLE IS SET

To compile the code there are 3 ways:

	Go to https://github.com/MilkyBruv/jocoa
	Clone or download and unzip the repo to a destination on your computer

	Go to https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#msys2 (Windows), https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#macports (Mac), Or choose your Linux distro
	Download and install the mingw build tools into "your/folder/msys64/" ("C:/msys64" is recommended for windows)
	Add "your/folder/msys64/mingw64/bin" to your PATH
	Test it was installed properly by opening the command line and running "gcc"
	The command shoudl return something along the lines of "gcc: fatal error: no input files, compilation terminated."

	Go to the root folder of the local repo in any command line and run "make"

	If this does not work, type "g++ src/main/main.cpp -o your/folder/jocoa/jocoa.exe" ("C:/jocoa/jocoa.exe" is recommended for windows)
	If you get any errors, make sure mingw64 is installed properly, and that the folders you specify exist (provide full path)
	Then add "your/folder/jocoa" to your PATH
	Go to the root folder of the code (./outcome) in the command line
	Run "jocoa run"


	OR


	Use an IDE of your choosing and run the src/main/Main.java file


	OR


	Run "javac -d bin -cp .;lib/gluegen-rt-natives-windows-amd64.jar;lib/gluegen-rt.jar;lib/joal-natives-windows-amd64.jar;lib/joal.jar;lib/jogl-all-natives-windows-amd64.jar;lib/jogl-all.jar;json-simple-tag_release_1_1_1.jar src/asset/*.java src/camera/*.java src/common/*.java src/entity/*.java src/entity/item/*.java src/entity/item/items/*.java src/entity/player/*.java src/entity/player/hud/inventory/*.java src/entity/rect/*.java src/entity/tile/*.java src/event/*.java src/game/*.java src/gfx/*.java src/gfx/ui/*.java src/gfx/ui/elements/*.java src/main/*.java src/map/*.java src/sfx/*.java src/shader/*.java src/tileset/*.java"
	
	Run "java -cp .;bin;lib/gluegen-rt-natives-windows-amd64.jar;lib/gluegen-rt.jar;lib/joal-natives-windows-amd64.jar;lib/joal.jar;lib/jogl-all-natives-windows-amd64.jar;lib/jogl-all.jar;json-simple-tag_release_1_1_1.jar -Djava.library.path=./natives main/Main""
